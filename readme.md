Tic Tac Toe Game with AI Algorithms

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features multiple AI algorithms that make it challenging to play against the computer. The AI can be switched between five different algorithms, each with unique strategies for determining its next move.
Game Features

    Single-player mode: Play against the computer AI.
    Five AI algorithms: Choose between different difficulty levels and strategies.
    Reset functionality: The game resets after each match, allowing continuous play.
    Win detection and scoring: Automatically detects wins and blocks the opponent's winning moves.

AI Algorithms Implemented

    Minimax Algorithm
    Alpha-Beta Pruning
    Negamax Algorithm
    Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
    Heuristics

1. Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making process for two-player games. It works by recursively evaluating all possible future game states to minimize the loss and maximize the win for the current player.

How it's used:

    Minimax evaluates the game board and explores all possible future states until the game ends.
    It assumes that both players will play optimally, selecting the move that leads to the best outcome for the AI and the worst outcome for the opponent.

Why it's used:

    It ensures that the AI always makes the best possible move, but it can be computationally expensive.

2. Alpha-Beta Pruning

The Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm is an optimization of Minimax that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree. It prunes (cuts off) branches that don't need to be explored because they can't affect the final decision.

How it's used:

    Alpha-Beta Pruning is applied to speed up the Minimax process.
    It eliminates the need to explore game states that wouldn't impact the outcome, significantly improving performance.

Why it's used:

    This allows the AI to make the same optimal decisions as Minimax but much faster by skipping unnecessary calculations.

3. Negamax Algorithm

The Negamax algorithm is a simplified version of Minimax that reduces complexity by leveraging symmetry between maximizing and minimizing players. It uses a single evaluation function but changes the sign based on whose turn it is.

How it's used:

    Negamax simplifies the codebase by applying the same logic for both players, reducing the need for separate evaluation functions for maximizing and minimizing turns.

Why it's used:

    It provides a more concise implementation of the Minimax logic while still offering optimal gameplay performance.

4. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a more probabilistic algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation by simulating random playouts of the game. MCTS builds a tree where each node represents a game state and branches out by simulating random moves.

How it's used:

    MCTS explores potential moves by randomly playing out game scenarios and evaluating which leads to the best overall outcome.
    It works by sampling different possible moves, expanding the most promising nodes, and updating the decision tree based on the results.

Why it's used:

    MCTS allows for more intelligent decision-making in large state spaces where evaluating all outcomes is impractical.
    This method makes the AI behave more unpredictably, making it harder to play against, while still aiming for an optimal win.

5. Heuristics

Heuristics are simple, rule-based evaluations of the game board. They assign scores to different board states based on predefined criteria like center control, corner control, blocking the opponent, or setting up a win.

How it's used:

    A heuristic evaluation function is used to estimate how favorable a board state is for the AI.
    The AI looks for moves that lead to the highest heuristic score, focusing on moves that could lead to a win or block the opponent.

Why it's used:

    Heuristics are computationally efficient and allow the AI to make reasonably smart moves without evaluating all game possibilities.
    While not perfect, they offer fast gameplay decisions with a reasonable challenge.

How to Play

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tictactoe-ai

    Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.

    Select an AI algorithm from the dropdown menu.

    The game will alternate between human and AI turns. The first player is always human.

    After a game ends (either a win or a draw), the game board resets automatically for a new round.

How the AI Works

    AI vs. Human: The player always plays first as 'X', and the AI follows as 'O'.
    Switching Algorithms: You can change the AI algorithm during the game using a dropdown menu, allowing you to see how each algorithm performs.
    Reset Feature: Once the game ends, whether by a win, draw, or loss, the board will reset after a brief delay.

Future Improvements

    Further optimization of AI algorithms to improve performance.
    Add a UI feature to track player scores.
    Improve the heuristics function to make the AI smarter for different playstyles.
